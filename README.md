###Conway's Game of Life
This is my implementation of John Conway's cellular automata named the Game of Life using the P5.js library. The cellular automaton in the Game of life exist in a 2D grid of cells. The state of a cell in the next generation depends on its previous state and the state of its surrounding neighbors. A living cell with fewer than 2 neighbors dies by underpopulation, and dies by overpopulation if it has more than 3 neighbors. All other living cells survive. A dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes alive by reproduction. 

These simple rules gives rise to complex systems, of which many different stable configurations have been studied. The simulation allows for the selection of a random seed or to fill in a desired initial configuration before beginning upon the run button being pressed.
